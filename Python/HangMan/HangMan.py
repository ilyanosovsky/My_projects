# Instructions
# The computer choose a random word and mark stars for each letter of each word.
# Then the player will guess a letter.
# If that letter is in the word(s) then the computer fills the letter in all the correct positions of the word.
# If the letter isnâ€™t in the word(s) then add a body part to the gallows (head, body, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg).
# The player will continue guessing letters until they can either solve the word(s) (or phrase) or all six body parts are on the gallows.
# The player canâ€™t guess the same letter twice.
